    question: 'How do I actually get my money?',
    answer:
      'We connect your platform directly to your own Stripe or PayPal account. When a student pays, the money goes straight to you. Teachwell never touches it, and we don’t take a percentage. You keep every penny of your fees.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need to be tech-savvy to run this?',
    answer:
      'No. We build the site and handle the hosting for you. Once Teachwell is live, you get a simple dashboard where you can drag and drop your course content and manage your students.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Who actually owns the student data?',
    answer:
      'You do. Unlike big marketplaces, Teachwell doesn’t own your student list or your course materials. Everything stays private to your brand. We provide the infrastructure, but you retain 100% ownership of your business data.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I use my own domain name?',
    answer:
      'Yes. If you already have your own domain name, we can link it to your platform. Alternatively, we supply you with a custom domain name as part of our Pro and Enterprise plans to keep your brand front and centre.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens if I need help?',
    answer:
      'You won’t be talking to a bot. Depending on your plan, you’ll have a direct line to the Teachwell team via email or a private Telegram chat. We set up the system, so we can usually fix or explain things in minutes.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Am I locked into a contract?',
    answer:
      'No. Teachwell operates on a simple monthly subscription. You can cancel whenever you want with no exit fees. If you decide to leave, you can take your student data and course materials with you.',
  },

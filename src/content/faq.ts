    question: 'How do I actually get my money?',
    answer:
      'We connect your platform directly to your own Stripe or PayPal account. When a student pays, the money goes straight to you. We never touch it, and we don’t take a percentage. You keep every penny of your fees.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Do I need to be tech-savvy to run this?',
    answer:
      'No. We build the site and handle the hosting for you. Once it’s live, you get a simple dashboard where you can drag and drop your videos and manage your students. If you can use basic apps, you can use this.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Who actually owns the student data?',
    answer:
      'You do. Unlike big marketplaces, we don’t own your student list or your course materials. Everything stays private to your brand. We provide the infrastructure, but you retain 100% ownership of your business data.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I use my own domain name?',
    answer:
      'Yes. On our Pro and Enterprise plans, we’ll help you link your own domain. It looks more professional and keeps your brand front and centre for your students.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What happens if I need help?',
    answer:
      'You won’t be talking to a bot. Depending on your plan, you’ll have a direct line to us via email or a private Telegram chat. We set up the system, so we can usually fix or explain things in minutes.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Am I locked into a contract?',
    answer:
      'No. Everything is a simple monthly subscription. You can cancel whenever you want with no exit fees. If you decide to leave, you can take your student data and course materials with you.',
  },
